# tool configurator

### Overview
The tool configurator will reside on our consumer website between info gathering and purchase phases. Interested customers should be able to “Configure this tool” on the product page > build the tool to their configuration > Request a quote. It will be the goal of this project to determine how best to structure the data required. For the project, I will select an easy to configure tool and our most complicated tool in order to lay out the user flow.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to step through the configuration of a tool or system to meet the needs of my job with space to add notes/customizations.
- As a Sales Rep, I want all the info required to build an accurate sales quote.
- As a user, I want to be able to add other configurable components to my “quote” (i.e. configured an ABX-500, now I need a Badger); save summary and open new configurator
- As a developer… something about the data…
